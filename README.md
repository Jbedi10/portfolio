# Portfolio
midterm and final portfolio for STA 518

For this portfolio project I am going to attemtp to create a program that can predict the second half of the Premier League - and in turn show the winner!

## Table of Contents.

1. Import, manage, and clean data.
2. Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations.
3. Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments.
4. Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs.
5. Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs.

How I will fulfill the course objectives with my portfolio project:
1. https://datahub.io/sports-data/english-premier-league#resource-season-1819
2. I will be able to show 'Goals-For' and 'Goals-Against' - determining weak offense and strong defense / vice-versa.
3. This project will take data from the first half of the season and try to predict the winner 
4. Footnotes will be used throughout this project

## Essays
Growth as a Data Person: I believe once finished with STA 518 my ability to create tools for visualization will have immensly increased. This is my first course with R and I am thourghouly enjoying every minute. I have mostly work in Python for coding so I like how coding in R is done. I have taken a Java class before and was completely lost to say the least. I beleive this course will help me grow in my professional life as well. We are about half way through the course now, I am excited to work on this project solo and the group project. Once those are complete I believe my ability to tell stories with data will be a great tool to bring to my future employers!
