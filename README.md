# Portfolio
midterm and final portfolio for STA 518

For this portfolio project I am going to attemtp to create a program that can predict the second half of the Premier League - and in turn show the winner!

## Table of Contents.

1. Import, manage, and clean data.
2. Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations.
3. Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments.
4. Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs.
5. Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs.

How I will fulfill the course objectives with my portfolio project:
1. https://datahub.io/sports-data/english-premier-league#resource-season-1819
2. I will be able to show 'Goals-For' and 'Goals-Against' - determining weak offense and strong defense / vice-versa.
3. This project will take data from the first half of the season and try to predict the winner 
4. Footnotes will be used throughout this project

## Essays
Growth as a Data Person: I believe once finished with STA 518 my ability to create tools for visualization will have immensly increased. This is my first course with R and I am thourghouly enjoying every minute. I have mostly work in Python for coding so I like how coding in R is done. I have taken a Java class before and was completely lost to say the least. I beleive this course will help me grow in my professional life as well. We are about half way through the course now, I am excited to work on this project solo and the group project. Once those are complete I believe my ability to tell stories with data will be a great tool to bring to my future employers!

## Lightning Round: 
1. What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.
2. What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why
3. What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.
4. Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a semester of STA 418/518 that will help them be successful in learning.

1. So far the most difficult part of the class for me is switching my mind set from pyton to R. All of my classes so far in coding have been in Python.
However, I do feel like im making strides in my coding with R. And I do believe this project - will show case that.
2. Learning the flow of the class has been the easiest for me, and quite frankly the most enjoyable. I like that I am learning as I am going. Instead of lecturing the class we're esentially lecturing ourselves. I consider myself a visual learner and the preperations have given me the ability to work out problems on my own ( with google of coruse :) ).
3. The no grading system for sure surprised me the most. I have NEVER been in a class where I didnt earn a grade for every assignment that I did. I like this style of class because if you do the work now you'll reap the rewards. Anyone can memorize something for a test. This class makes you work, but in a good way. Im sure people could get away with not doing much in the class, but since I am going to be using these techniques in my work, I am learning for myself, not a grade!
4. GO TO CLASS - that is the biggest advice I can give to anyone. Even if you think you have mastered the material, GO TO CLASS. My freshamn year of undergrad I didnt go to class much, because I knew most of the material. However, I was never able to have my questions answered when they came into mind. Learning the materials in a class setting is so much better. Also come in with an attitude that you are learning this to better yourself as a professional. I get it some Gen-Ed coruses that are necessary to graduate are boring and material is dry. But if you're in this class chances are you want to do something with Data. Show up, Pay attention, ask questions, and do your work. Simple as that!
