# Portfolio
midterm and final portfolio for STA 518

For this portfolio project I changed it from a perdiction model as I was struggling to figure out the funtions for that. However, I did create a deep dive into the Premier League seasons of 06 - 18. I am a huge Chelsea fan, and majority of my friends who watch the premier League are huge Mancheseter United fans. We go back and forth as to which team is better. So I did a comparison of stats soley focused on Manchester United, "The biggest team in world football"

## Course Objectives
1. Import, manage, and clean data.
2. Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations.
3. Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments.
4. Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs.
5. Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs.

How I will fulfill the course objectives with my portfolio project:
1. ~/STA 518/Final Project/Portfolio/Final Proposal/Final Draft Portfolio/results.csv - groupby statements, mutate statements, summarise statments, clean NA.
2. I will be able to create graphs for overall wins / overall goals for all teams in the premier league to show how manchester united stacks up agains the competition. And from their be able to create analysis once graphs are plotted. 
3. https://www.rdocumentation.org/ was my go to for trouble shooting 
4. https://www.rdocumentation.org/ helped me trouble shoot parameters for multiple graphs on my project.
