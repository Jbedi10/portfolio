## Most Difficult Part of the Class

So far the most difficult part of the class for me is switching my mind set from pyton to R. All of my classes so far in coding have been in Python. However, I do feel like im making strides in my coding with R. And I do believe this project - will show case that. As the course has progressed I do believe that trying to remember every function / topic we have went over is kind of leaving my brain. Since I have started coding I have realized that learning and applying are two completely different aspects of schooling. It is extremely easy to memorize things for an exam, but when it comes to actually applying what you learned in real life the prep and memorazation serve you no purpose. I have tried extremely hard, in all coding classes to try and not memorize things but learn them for the long term. With R, for me, I cant remember function names and how they work for the life of me! It might be because I have had 0 experience in the language prior. Graphing and plotting wasn't too tricky as the chunk of code is interchangable - also reading graphs isnt too bad. But I do not believe that I could get very analytical with them. I could scratch the surface on analysis, however pulling actual answers from a graph has always been dificult for me. I know this class wasnt focused too much on finding answers with graphs, which I appreciated. But I do beleive that is one thing i canwork on in the future.
