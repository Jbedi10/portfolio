## What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why
2. Learning the flow of the class has been the easiest for me, and quite frankly the most enjoyable. I like that I am learning as I am going. Instead of lecturing the class we're esentially lecturing ourselves. I consider myself a visual learner and the preperations have given me the ability to work out problems on my own ( with google of coruse :) ).
